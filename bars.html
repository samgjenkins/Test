<h1>My Trip to Austin, TX: a Hyperlink Story</h1>

<h2>The Bars</h2>

<p>
    The bar scene in downtown Austin is wonderfully diverse, offering something for everybody. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Our favorites were often the more "hole-in-the-wall" locations, such as <a href="https://www.bartonspringssaloonatx.com/" target="_blank">BS Saloon</a> and the <a href="https://themeaneyedcat.com/" target="_blank">Mean Eyed Cat.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    But <a href="thanks.html">before we knew it...</a>
