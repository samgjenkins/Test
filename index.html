<h1>My Trip to Austin, TX: a Hyperlink Story</h1>

<h2>Hello!</h2>

<p>
    My name is Sam Jenkins, and over spring break I visited Austin, Texas with my older sister. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We went for four days and three nights, and saw a good amount of <a href="capitol.html">the  city</a> while we were there.
